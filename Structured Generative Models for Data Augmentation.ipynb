    "Last week I had the priveledge to attend the MLSS, a Machine Learning conference/summer school where some of the most well-known ML researchers gave 4.5 hour presentations. At one point David Blai and Frank Wood spoke back and forth about the idea of using a generative model to augment a dataset that would be used to train a discrimanitive model. Blai was sceptical since the generative model would have been trained on the same information as the discrimanitive and thus wouldnt create any new information, but Wood countered that Blai was missing one detail. The generative model would have _structure_ built into it. Any prior knowledge that we have about the dataset could be programed into the generative machinery, and that prior knowledge could theoretically bring something new to the table when training the discriminative model. \n",
